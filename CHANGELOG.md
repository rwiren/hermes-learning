## [0.12.0] - 2026-04-16: The "Automation" Update
**Feature Release: Stage 4 Data Pipeline Automation.**

### ⚙️ Data Pipeline
*   **Automation Orchestrator:** Implemented `run_pipeline.py` to automate the execution of the Stage 2 (Transformation) and Stage 3 (Storage) data pipeline.
*   **Workflow Integration:** The master script is designed for easy integration into automation frameworks like cron jobs or GitHub Actions.
*   **Robust Logging:** Integrated comprehensive logging to `pipeline.log` for improved debugging and pipeline monitoring.

---

## [0.11.0] - 2026-04-16: The "Data Lake" Update
**Feature Release: Stage 3 Data Storage Solution.**

### ⚙️ Data Pipeline
*   **Storage Management Layer:** Implemented `src/storage/storage_manager.py` to move processed telemetry from `data/processed` into a dedicated `data/storage` local data lake.
*   **Partition Preservation:** The storage manager maintains the date-based partitioning (`YYYY-MM-DD`) established in Stage 2.
*   **Automated Transfer:** Includes logic to automatically transfer files and clean up empty source directories.

---

## [0.10.0] - 2026-04-16: The "Telemetry Transformation" Update
**Feature Release: Stage 2 Data Transformation & Processing Pipeline.**

### ⚙️ Data Pipeline
*   **Telemetry Transformation Layer:** Implemented `src/processing/transformer.py` to process raw JSON telemetry into strictly typed, ML-ready datasets.
*   **Validation Layer:** Enforces strict sanity checks on ICAO Hex formats (6-character hex strings) and spatial coordinate bounds (Latitude -90 to 90, Longitude -180 to 180).
*   **Data Transformation:** Flattens hierarchical JSON payloads into standardized tabular records.
*   **Storage & Partitioning:** Converts and loads sanitized data into time-series Parquet format (with CSV fallback) optimized for batch ML workloads, partitioned by date (YYYY-MM-DD).
*   **Metadata Integration:** Seamlessly incorporates Stage 1 `anomaly_corrected` metadata flags into the final ML schema.

---

## [0.9.0] - 2026-04-13: The "Sky View" Update
**Feature Release: Native 3D ADS-B Visualization (Three.js).**

### 🛰 3D Sky View
* **`⟁ 3D SKY` tab:** A new tab bar at the top of the page switches between the existing Leaflet 2D map and a native Three.js 3D scene.  Switching costs zero additional server requests — both views share the same `map_update` SocketIO stream.
* **Aircraft cones:** 4-sided cones pointing in the direction of travel (heading derived from `track`), coloured by the existing sensor-coverage scheme (white = trilateration lock).
* **Altitude stems:** Each aircraft has a vertical line from its ground-projection dot to its altitude-exaggerated 3D position — makes altitude discrepancies and "teleportation" spoofing immediately visible.
* **Ground track trails:** Last 60 position fixes rendered as a polyline at ground level, matching the 2D dashed-trail feature.
* **TDOA uncertainty spheres:** For full-lock (N+W+E) aircraft the 2D amber circle becomes a semi-transparent 3D sphere, radius driven by `tdoa_uncertainty_m`.
* **Spoof rings:** Pulsing flat rings around aircraft with `spoof_score ≥ 0.35` (red for ≥ 0.5, amber otherwise), matching the 2D spoof-ring style.
* **FL reference planes:** Subtle translucent horizontal slabs at FL100, FL200, and FL350 provide altitude context without cluttering the scene.
* **Sensor node pyramids:** North (blue) / West (green) / East (red) upright pyramids with 100 km and 200 km coverage rings matching the 2D map toggles.
* **Altitude exaggeration slider:** "ALT EXAG" overlay (1× – 50×, default 10×) scales the Y axis live so traffic layers at FL100/200/350 become clearly separated; updates instantly without waiting for the next SocketIO event.
* **OrbitControls:** Left-drag to orbit, right-drag/two-finger to pan, scroll to zoom. `T` toggles 2D ↔ 3D; `R` resets camera to top-down tactical view (~350 km altitude).
* **Engine choice — Three.js vs CesiumJS:** Three.js (~170 KB CDN, MIT) was chosen over CesiumJS (~3.5 MB + tile server/Ion token) because the Helsinki FIR sensor triangle spans only ~300 km — a flat XZ plane with ~10 lines of lat/lon projection maths is sufficient and keeps the dashboard fully self-contained with no external account required.

### 🗑 Removed
* All Aviar Labs / external 3D platform references removed from `dashboard.py`, `README.md`, `dashboard/README.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md`.  The dashboard no longer links to or depends on any third-party commercial aviation platform.

### 📖 Documentation
* **`dashboard/README.md`**: bumped to v4.0; replaced the third-party integration bullet with the full 3D Sky View feature description.
* **`README.md`**: replaced the "Companion Visualization" section with a "🛰 3D Sky View" section including a Three.js vs CesiumJS comparison table, scene element inventory, and control reference.

### 🔄 Dashboard
* **`dashboard.py`** bumped to v4.0.0.  All spoofing heuristics, TDOA uncertainty visualisation, anomaly overlay, jamming detection, and TAK/Palantir tactical styling from v3.5.0 are fully preserved.  No new Python dependencies.

---

## [0.8.1] - 2026-02-01: The "Elastic Grid" Milestone
**Major Feature Release: TDOA Synchronization, Clock Drift Compensation, and Multi-Sensor Triangulation.**

### 🚀 Physics & Synchronization (Scientific Proof)
* **Elastic Grid Algorithm:** Implemented a linear heartbeat model ($True\_Time = t_{raw} - (Bias + Drift \times dt)$) to compensate for non-coherent SDR clock drift across the grid.
* **Drift Quantification:** Successfully measured and corrected for individual hardware crystal errors:
    * **Sensor-West (Jorvas):** **+273 PPM** (Fast clock).
    * **Sensor-East (Sibbo):** **-51 PPM** (Slow clock).
* **Golden Packet Harvester:** Added `analyze_tdoa_v23_golden_harvester.py` to identify simultaneous 3-node detections for definitive triangulation proof.
* **Robust Solver:** Integrated a 4-variable Robust Least Squares optimizer (`v15_elastic_solver.py`) to solve for Lat/Lon offsets and drift rates simultaneously using commercial aircraft as "Signals of Opportunity."

### 📊 Visualization (Scientific Evidence)
* **Golden Cross Map:** Developed `v28_golden_cross_final.py` for high-precision validation. Features **Purple (N-W)** and **Red (N-E)** dotted TDOA hyperbolas intersecting at GPS ground truth.
* **Color Standardization:** Anchored the visual schema for all research artifacts:
    * **🟦 North (Master):** Blue (PPS-disciplined anchor).
    * **🟩 West (Slave):** Green (+273 PPM).
    * **🟥 East (Slave):** Red (-51 PPM).
* **Full-Scale Projections:** Updated mapping logic (`v21_master_final.py`) to visualize full hyperbolic curves across 200km+ baselines without clipping.

### 🔬 Documentation & Wiki
* **Project Wiki Update:** Completed **Chapter 15 (Hardware Considerations)**, providing a technical comparison between DS3231 (TCXO) stability vs. GNSS PPS clock disciplining.
* **LaTeX Standards:** Hardened math documentation with double-escaped underscores (`\\_`) to ensure universal MathJax/Markdown rendering for the synchronization formula.
* **Procedural Guide:** Documented the "Triple-Baseline Calibration" workflow (Harvest -> Solve -> Validate).

### 🐛 Fixes
* **Clock Skew:** Resolved the "300km Drift Error" where uncompensated SDR crystals caused TDOA lines to miss targets by massive margins within 10 seconds of capture.
* **Visualization Bounds:** Fixed `v17_elastic_map_fixed.py` where distant aircraft (>100km) were previously cut off by hardcoded axis limits.
* **Ambiguity Error:** Resolved `ValueError` in Python analysis scripts caused by ambiguous truth values during Pandas Series comparisons in the map generator.

* **Windowed Reporting:** Added `--window` argument to EDA pipeline. Reports can now slice data by "Last 24h", "48h", or "Total History".
* **Training Export:** Pipeline now auto-generates `training_dataset_v4_ensemble.csv` for future Supervised Learning (XGBoost).

### 🐛 Fixes
* **Data Ingestion:** Fixed pipeline crash caused by mismatched paths (`infra/ansible` vs root) and GZIP handling.
* **Robustness:** Added fault tolerance to `infra_health.py` to skip corrupted CSV lines instead of crashing.
* **Dashboard Mappings:** Fixed "No Data" bug in Grafana by aligning `host` tag to `syslog_hostname`.

# 🔬 Research Goal: The "Elastic Manifold" Defense

To detect and mitigate GNSS spoofing attacks on civilian aviation tracking systems (ADS-B) using a distributed sensor grid and a **Hybrid AI Model Zoo**. This project moves beyond simple signal strength thresholding to a multi-layered defense strategy capable of identifying sophisticated trajectory modification attacks, "ghost" aircraft injections, and hardware-level signal cloning.

The core innovation is the **Elastic Manifold Architecture**: a system that validates aircraft not just by physics (speed/altitude), but by **topology** (mathematical constraints), **time** (elastic synchronization), and **hardware signatures** (RF fingerprinting).

# ⚙️ Data Pipeline
This section details the various stages of data processing, from raw ingestion to ML-ready datasets.

### Stage 1: Ingestion & Scraper (Conceptual)
Responsible for extracting raw JSON telemetry. This stage is external to this repository's core processing logic but provides the input to Stage 2.

### Stage 2: Telemetry Transformation & Processing (`src/processing/transformer.py`)
This crucial layer processes raw JSON telemetry into strictly typed, validated, and ML-ready tabular datasets.

*   **Validation Layer:** Enforces strict sanity checks on:
    *   **ICAO Hex formats:** 6-character hexadecimal strings.
    *   **Spatial coordinate bounds:** Latitude (-90 to 90), Longitude (-180 to 180).
*   **Data Transformation:** Flattens hierarchical JSON payloads into standardized tabular records.
*   **Storage Encoding:** Converts and loads sanitized data into time-series Parquet format (with CSV fallback if needed), optimized for batch ML workloads.
*   **Partitioning Strategy:** Implements robust data partitioning by date (YYYY-MM-DD) for efficient data retrieval.
*   **Metadata Integration:** Seamlessly incorporates `anomaly_corrected` metadata flags from Stage 1 into the final ML schema.

### Stage 3: Telemetry Storage Solution (`src/storage/storage_manager.py`)
This layer moves processed telemetry into a dedicated `data/storage` local data lake, preserving the date-based partitioning.

*   **Storage Management Layer:** Implemented `src/storage/storage_manager.py` to manage the storage of processed telemetry data.
*   **Partition Preservation:** The storage manager maintains the date-based partitioning (`YYYY-MM-DD`) established in Stage 2.
*   **Automated Transfer:** Includes logic to automatically transfer files and clean up empty source directories.

* **13. Graph Neural Networks (GNN):** Modeling the sensor grid as a geometric graph to detect spatial anomalies (e.g., signals visible to Node A but impossibly occluded from Node B). (⚠️ *Planned*)
* **14. Graph Attention Networks (GAT):** Dynamic weighting of sensor reliability based on **Clock Drift (PPM)** stability, allowing the grid to "ignore" jammed nodes. (⚠️ *Planned*)

### Tier 4: Physics, Logic & Generative Validation
*High-level reasoning and adversarial testing (M4 Max / Server).*

* **15. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN):** Embedding Equations of Motion (Navier-Stokes/Kinematics) directly into the loss function to penalize physically impossible maneuvers. (✅ **Implemented**)
* **16. Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN):** Symbolic regression for real-time estimation of aerodynamic coefficients (Lift/Drag). Flags targets flying with impossible parameters. (✅ **Implemented**)
* **17. RL-Enhanced GAN (RL-GAN):** "The Smart Red Team." Uses Reinforcement Learning to guide the Generator (GAN), rewarding it for successfully bypassing specific Tier 1-3 defenses. (✅ **Implemented as GAN**)
* **18. Ollama Reasoning Swarm (DeepSeek-R1 / Llama 3 / Phi-3):** "The Investigator." Validated ensemble of LLMs analyzing MQTT-based incident logs. Benchmarks confirm efficacy in parsing complex, multi-variable anomaly scenarios (SecuringSkies Benchmarks). (✅ **Benchmarked & Implemented**)

### 🛡️ Manifold Defense System (Integration)
The project orchestrates these tiers into a single decision engine, formerly referred to as the **ManifoldGuard Ensemble**.

**Key Features:**
- **Weighted Ensemble Vote:** A voting mechanism where Tier 0 (Physics) has veto power over Tier 2/3 (AI).
- **Lightweight Inference:** Optimized for **Raspberry Pi 5 + Hailo-8 NPU** (~30ms latency with full ensemble).
- **Graceful Fallback:** System degrades safely from "Full Manifold Defense" to "Basic RF Filtering" if hardware resources are constrained.
- **Distributed Trust:** Uses **GAT** and **Elastic TDOA** to dynamically identify and isolate compromised sensors in the grid.
- **ONNX Export:** Tier 1-3 models are ready for NPU acceleration.

## 🛰 3D Sky View — Native Three.js Visualization

The dashboard includes a built-in **3D Sky View** tab alongside the standard Leaflet 2D map.  It is implemented entirely in [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) (MIT licence, ~170 KB CDN, no tile server, no external account) and reuses the same `map_update` SocketIO stream that powers the 2D view — switching between modes costs zero additional server requests.

### Why Three.js and not CesiumJS?

| | **CesiumJS** | **Three.js (chosen)** |
|---|---|---|
| Bundle size | ~3.5 MB + tile server | ~170 KB CDN core |
| Globe model | Real WGS-84 ellipsoid | Flat XZ plane (sufficient for ~300 km FIR area) |
| External dependency | Cesium Ion token or self-hosted terrain | None — fully offline-capable |
| Coordinate maths | Built-in ECEF helpers | ~10 lines of manual lat/lon → km projection |
| Fit for this project | Overkill for a regional sensor grid | Ideal — lightweight, single-file, zero signup |

CesiumJS excels when you need a planetary-scale globe with streaming terrain and satellite imagery. For the Helsinki FIR sensor triangle (~50–80 km baselines), a flat Three.js scene with a 10 km ground grid is the right tool.

### What the 3D view reveals that 2D cannot

- **Altitude layering** — at 10× exaggeration, FL100 / FL200 / FL350 become clearly separated vertical layers.  A "ghost" aircraft reported at FL350 that is geometrically impossible at that altitude becomes immediately obvious.
- **TDOA uncertainty volumes** — the TDOA error radius becomes a 3D semi-transparent sphere instead of a flat circle, giving a more scientifically honest representation of localisation quality.
- **Altitude stems** — a vertical line from the ground projection to the aircraft position makes altitude discrepancies visually striking (e.g., an aircraft "teleporting" between altitude layers shows as an abrupt stem change).
- **Sensor LoS geometry** — orbiting the camera to a side angle shows which sensor nodes have unobstructed geometric line-of-sight to a target at its reported altitude.

### Controls

| Control | Action |
|---|---|
| Left drag | Orbit camera |
| Right drag / two-finger pan | Pan |
| Scroll | Zoom |
| `T` | Toggle 2D ↔ 3D |
| `R` | Reset camera to top-down tactical view |
| ALT EXAG slider | Live altitude exaggeration 1× – 50× (default 10×) |

### Scene elements

- **Ground grid** — 600 km × 600 km, 10 km cells, TAK dark palette
- **Sensor nodes** — coloured upright pyramids (blue North / green West / red East)
- **Coverage rings** — 100 km and 200 km rings per node (matching 2D toggles)
- **FL reference planes** — translucent horizontal slabs at FL100, FL200, FL350
- **Aircraft cones** — 4-sided cones pointing in the direction of travel, coloured by sensor coverage (white = trilateration lock)
- **Altitude stems** — vertical line from ground shadow to aircraft position
- **Ground track trails** — polyline of last 60 position fixes at ground level
- **TDOA uncertainty spheres** — amber semi-transparent sphere for full-lock aircraft
- **Spoof rings** — pulsing red/amber flat rings around suspect aircraft, driven by `spoof_score`

## 🤝 How to Contribute

We follow a strict DevOps workflow to ensure integrity across Apple Silicon, Intel, and Windows.

### 1. The Golden Rule
**Main is protected.** Never push directly to main. Always use a feature branch.

### 2. Workflow
1.  **Sync:** `git checkout main && git pull origin main`
2.  **Branch:** `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
3.  **Test:** Run `make report` (Must pass locally!)
4.  **Commit:** Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`).
5.  **Merge:** Open a Pull Request.

### 3. Setup
- **Vault Password:** You need the project secret to decrypt configuration files.
    - *Action:* Ask the Maintainer for the password, then run:
    - `read -rs VAULT_PASS && echo "$VAULT_PASS" > .vault_pass`
    - *(Using `read -rs` avoids storing the password in shell history.)*
- **Environment:** Run `make setup` to initialize the Python environment.
